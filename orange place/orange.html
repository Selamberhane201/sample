                    <h1>What is Orange juice</h1>
                    <p>Orange juice is a liquid extract of the orange tree fruit, produced by squeezing or reaming oranges. It comes in several different varieties, including blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, clementine, and tangerine. As well
                        as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing amounts of juice vesicles, known as "pulp" in American English, and "(juicy) bits" in British English. These vesicles contain the juice of the orange and can be left
                        in or removed during the manufacturing process. How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season. In American English, the beverage name is often abbreviated as "OJ".</p>

                    <h1>Is homemade orange juice healthy?</h1>
                    <p>Orange juice is nutritious, but it's important to limit your consumption because of its high sugar content. Orange juice is an excellent source of Vitamin C — one cup contains twice the daily recommended value. Vitamin C supports your
                        immune system and may be effective in fighting against the common cold.</p>
